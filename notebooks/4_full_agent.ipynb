    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/agent_header.png\" width=\"800\" style=\"display:block; margin-left:0;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can put everything we have learned together:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will use **TODOs** to keep track of tasks. \n",
    "* We will use **files** to store raw tool call results. \n",
    "* We will **delegate research tasks to sub-agents** for context isolation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Tool \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a search tool that offloads raw contents to files and returns only a summary to the agent. This is a common pattern for long-running agent trajectories, [as we've seen with Manus](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus)! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search Execution (`run_tavily_search`)**: Performs the actual web search using Tavily API with configurable parameters for results count and topic filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Content Summarization (`summarize_webpage_content`)**: Uses a lightweight model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate structured summaries of webpage content, producing both a descriptive filename and key learnings summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Processing (`process_search_results`)**: Fetches full webpage content via HTTP, converts HTML to markdown using `markdownify`, and generates summaries for each result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Context Offloading (`tavily_search` tool)**: The main tool that:\n",
    "   - Executes search and processes results\n",
    "   - Saves full content to files in agent state (context offloading)\n",
    "   - Returns only minimal summaries to the agent (prevents context spam)\n",
    "   - Uses LangGraph `Command` to update both files and messages\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Strategic Thinking (`think_tool`)**: Provides a structured reflection mechanism for agents to analyze findings, assess gaps, and plan next steps in their research workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture solves the token efficiency problem by storing detailed search results in files while keeping the agent's working context minimal and focused."
